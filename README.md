@__spv			- jailbreak "framework", patchfinder, untether, UI, website,
			  logo, tbd

@JonathanSeals		- CBPatcher (parts of which are used in the p0laris
				     patchfinder)
@dora2ios		- daibutsu patchfinder, which iirc is actually based on the

@REALKJCMEMBER (?)	- kernel pmap patching code
@tihmstar		- small amounts of code stolen from doubleH3lix
			  (springboard fixing stuff, permission stuff, and that's it
			   iirc)
